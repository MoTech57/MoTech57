## 👨‍💻 Cybersecurity Projects & Labs

### SQL Injection Attack & Defense Lab (Burp Suite + sqlmap)
- Practiced discovery and exploitation of SQL injection in controlled web-app labs.
- Extracted and analyzed database content; documented remediation via prepared statements and input validation.
- Repo: [MoTech57/SQL-Injection-Lab](https://github.com/MoTech57/SQL-Injection-Lab-Burp-Suite-Sqlmap-)

### Active Directory Monitoring & Splunk Threat Detection
- Built a Windows AD lab, forwarded logs to Splunk, created detection rules for brute-force and suspicious behavior.
- Automated basic alerting and created incident playbooks for triage.
- Repo: [`MoTech57/Active-Directory-Monitoring-Lab`](https://github.com/MoTech57/Active-Directory-Monitoring-Lab)

### Network Intrusion Detection Systems (Snort) Lab
- Deployed Snort to detect malicious traffic patterns in a segmented lab network.
- Tuned rules to reduce false positives and used Wireshark packet captures for deeper analysis.
- Repo: [`MoTech57/Intrusion-Detection-Systems-SNORT-`](https://github.com/MoTech57/Intrusion-Detection-Systems-SNORT-)

### Metasploit & Nmap Port Scanning Lab
- Performed reconnaissance and exploitation in isolated lab VMs (Metasploitable / Kali).
- Practiced post-exploitation basics and safe reporting.
- Repo:(https://github.com/MoTech57/MoTech57-Metasploit-Exploitation-and-Nmap-Port-Scan-Lab-))

### Wi-Fi Security Lab — WPA2 Cracking & Automation
- Tested WPA2 weaknesses in a controlled environment, automated monitor mode and capture workflows with scripts.
